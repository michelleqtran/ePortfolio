									<h2>Why I Chose Computer Science & Mathematics</h2>
									
									<p>When I was a junior in high school, worrying about my major and my future, I stumbled upon a quotation:</p>
									<blockquote>“I’m not sure what I’ll do, but—well, I want to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want to live where things happen on a big scale.</br>
									- F. Scott Fitzgerald</blockquote>
									<p>In that moment, I knew this quotation was a personal truth; I want to go place, I want to meet people. Above all, however, I wanted to learn and keep learning. After several Google searches and an in-depth cross-analysis of my skills and goals, I decided that computer science and mathematics were subjects that will challenge me. And it is a challenge I enjoy. I learned how to code, to problem-solve, and to search for applications of my studies in all walks of life. My growing passion for data science has led me to learn more about computing, ecology, wealth inequality, etc. The skills I gained has helped me to better analyze, and thus appreciate, the world around me.</p>

									<h2>In the Classroom</h2>
									
									<h3>Introduction to Civic Engagement</h3>
									<p>In fall 2015, I took Introduction to Civic Engagement as an elective for my Leadership Studies minor. The course has opened my eyes to the many facets of poverty that affect families in the local Third Ward community surrounding the university. In this course, we discussed food inequality, healthcare inequality, and educational inequality. This course taught me how to read research papers and public speaking skills. In addition, it also inspired me to always pursue a role of service to my community, and ultimately influenced my interest in making clean energy affordable.</p>
									<p><a href="files/HarlemChildrensZone.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a presentation I created for the course that gave me a better understanding of educational inequality that affects my service in the Bonner Leaders Program.
									
									<!--<h2>Outside the Classroom</h2>
									
									<h3>Data Analytics in Student Hands</h3>
									<p>In spring 2016, I joined a group called Data Analytics in Student Hands. As part of this organization I work with researchers to answer questions using data analytics. My involvement in this organization has been instrumental to my exposure to data science and to my goal of graduate school. My current projects are to visualize data of oyster growth based on temperature and salinity, as well as, to visualize on a map the demographics that KIPP charter schools serve in the Houston Area. </p>-->
